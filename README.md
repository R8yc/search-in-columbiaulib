A simple Chrome extension that enables users to quickly search the Columbia University Library's books and resources.
CU Library Search Chrome Extension
B/c when writing papers, I often need to find and download literature and materials through the library's website frequently, which requires setting the library's site as a bookmark and frequently opening, copying, and pasting to searches. so I simply coded a simple Chrome extension.
On any webpage, select what you want to search for, right-click with your mouse, and choose 'CU_Library' to directly pop up the search results in our school's library.
